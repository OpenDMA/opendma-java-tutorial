# Tutorial REST Server

This maven build combines the [opendma-rest-server](https://github.com/OpenDMA/opendma-rest-server) with the
[opendma-java-xmlrepo](https://github.com/OpenDMA/opendma-java-xmlrepo) and the SampleRepository.xml from this
tutorial.

The final server is then packaged as docker image and deployed to GitHub Container Registry and Docker Hub.
